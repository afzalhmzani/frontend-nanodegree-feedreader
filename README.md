# How I solved it
1. in `RSS Feed` suite I added two senarios: see all the URL and make sure they are not empty & and name as well.
2. In `The menu` suite I added two senarios: first, check if the DOM didden by default. then I checked on click either it hide or show.
3. In `Initial Entries` suite I checked if `LoadFeed()` has at lest one value.
4. In `New Feed selection` to check if new feed is loaded by the `LoadFeed()`
